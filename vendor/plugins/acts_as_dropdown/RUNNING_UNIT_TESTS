== Creating the test database

The test suite currently uses sqlite3 out of the box. I highly recommend using this configuration
for testing Rails plugins. If for some reason you can't install sqlite3 (and the required gem) you
can get the test suite to run with any other database adapter with a little tweaking of the
abstract_unit.rb file. 

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in the test directory. To execute the test do the following:

   ruby dropdown_test.rb
