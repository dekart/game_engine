[ ] change state field to something configurable...
[ ] or leave it out? (i.e. so just go workflow.state or workflow.current_state)
[x] make predicate querying of states, i.e. new? == true if state == :new
[ ] ... should states be objects, or should they be symbols?
[ ] refactor the tests, then the library :)
